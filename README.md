# How to improve your scalability as a tech company ?

The ability to effortlessly increase or decrease your capacity is a crucial concept for DevOps and Solutions Architects. 


An ideal situation for tech companies is to have the ability to increase the load of every single piece of infrastructure or application on demand.

Imagine that suddenly, a company is featured on the front page of the news. There's a good chance that their website will increase a substantial increase in traffic. 

But can the current infrastructure handle the uptick? If it can't [scale up](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/achieving-scalability-for-your-web-infrastructure/) to handle the increased traffic, there's a chance the website will crash, or load too slowly causing a negative experience for users.

In this article, we're going to explore the pitfalls of using hardware solutions, followed by the significant advantages tech companies can gain from cloud solutions. But before we do, let's look at two essential terms often heard when discussing scalability - vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. 

## Vertical and horizontal scaling
When discussing scaling up (and down), there are generally four areas that we're interested in. These are Disk I/O, Memory, Network I/O and CPU.  

### Scaling vertically 
Vertical scaling is considered by many to be the more straightforward and easier method of increasing resources. When scaling vertically, you're adding more power, such as more RAM, upping the number of processors, using more powerful CPUs, and using faster storage like SSD (Solid State Drives). 

### Scaling horizontally 
Instead of adding more resources to increase your power and speed, with horizontal scaling, you're growing your number of servers. 

This allows you to spread your loads across multiple servers. However, scaling horizontally also means you're adding a great deal of complexity to your system as you need to perform all of the regular admin tasks, like updates, security, monitoring, syncing your apps, backups and data across an increased number of instances. 

It's hard to declare one method is more beneficial than the other. Much depends on the company's requirements and circumstances when choosing how to scale. 

Using the above example, if the increased load on the server is only temporary, then scaling horizontally will give you a long-term advantage, but there's a chance the extra capacity will be redundant if traffic falls again. Where-as for short term needs, vertical scaling is the preferred choice. 

Many are arguing that the era of physical hardware is coming to an end. For tech companies to scale efficiently, they need to limit their usage of hardware and where-possible, use cloud alternatives. 

The cloud removes many of the hurdles allowing you and other tech companies greater flexibility with scaling. Because cloud servers are virtualized, updating power configurations, or adding more servers becomes almost trivial. 


## Pitfalls of hardware solutions for tech companies 

Relying on physical hardware solutions doesn't mean it's impossible to scale, but it does create further challenges. When talking about servers, one of the most significant drawbacks is cost, which isn't just limited to the purchase or rental price. 

High-quality servers aren't cheap, and there's more than just the initial purchase price to think about. You'll inevitably need to take your servers offline to perform maintenance, which can cause some disruption to your service and customers. 

There's also the issue of space. Physical servers require a particular environment. The temperature of the room needs to be carefully monitored and maintained. It also needs to be secure from physical threats, such as theft and natural disasters. 

Often this kind of room is limited by the space available. What happens when you need to add more servers? More servers equal more electricity and produce even more heat. If you're running physical servers and plan on scaling up, you're going to need much more space, and enough power to maintain your network properly. 

Looking at this example, it's no surprise that [94% of companies use the cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-computing) in some form.


## Benefits of virtual hardware for tech companies 

When discussing the benefits of cloud/virtual servers for a tech company, there are many advantages to its physical hardware counterpart.

When it's time to scale up no matter if it's for a long term or short team, you're able to 'spin up' a new server in little to no time at all. This means you don't need to purchase or loan a new server, physically install it, or perform ongoing maintenance and synchronization with your other servers. 

The versatility lets you utilize diverse servers for different workloads. Whether you're analyzing data or running software development tools, you can dictate how much power you need for each server depending on your intended use, while scaling up and down your operations smoothly. 

Another example of cloud solutions which are cheap, efficient and scalable to fit your needs comfortably are business VPNs. 

With a VPN, companies can set up a secure link for employees to connect to the network from remote locations. Unlike traditional proxy services, a business VPN [allows users to use the internet safely](https://www.perimeter81.com/next-gen-business-vpn), even if the website they're interacting with is not using HTTPS.

Why does this secure connection matter? The number of workers using their own unsecured device for work purposes has skyrocketed. According to research performed by [Clutch](https://www.aseonline.org/News/EverythingPeople-This-Week/ArtMID/543/ArticleID/1512/Use-of-Employee-Personal-Devices-for-Work), only 64% of employees are using an approved device for work, and only 40% use a device that's either monitored or cleared for security purposes. 

What are employees doing with their personal device? Nearly 90% of them are checking work-related emails which means they're connected to the company email server, and almost 70% are accessing shared company documents. 

When a company needs to scale, it isn't easy to source all the required hardware and create a safe network, especially when employees are connecting remotely. 

Cloud-based software solutions such as a business VPN allow companies to create secured devices without having to purchase new units and implement costly security programs. 

How do you improve your scalability as a tech company? It's simple. Limit your use of hardware and switch to cloud solutions where possible.
