##Pitfalls of hardware solutions for tech companies 

Relying on physical hardware solutions doesn't mean it's impossible to scale, but it does create further challenges. When talking about servers, one of the most significant drawbacks is cost, which isn't just limited to the purchase or rental price. 

High-quality servers aren't cheap, and there's more than just the initial purchase price to think about. You'll inevitably need to take your servers offline to perform maintenance, which can cause some disruption to your service and customers. 

There's also the issue of space. Physical servers require a particular environment. The temperature of the room needs to be carefully monitored and maintained. It also needs to be secure from physical threats, such as theft and natural disasters. 

Often this kind of room is limited by the space available. What happens when you need to add more servers? More servers equal more electricity and produce even more heat. If you're running physical servers and plan on scaling up, you're going to need much more space, and enough power to maintain your network properly. 

Looking at this example, it's no surprise that [94% of companies use the cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-computing) in some form.

Benefits of virtual hardware for tech companies 


When discussing the benefits of cloud/virtual servers for a tech company, there are many advantages to its physical hardware counterpart.

When it's time to scale up no matter if it's for a long term or short team, you're able to 'spin up' a new server in little to no time at all. This means you don't need to purchase or loan a new server, physically install it, or perform ongoing maintenance and synchronization with your other servers. 

The versatility lets you utilize diverse servers for different workloads. Whether you're analyzing data or running software development tools, you can dictate how much power you need for each server depending on your intended use, while scaling up and down your operations smoothly. 

Another example of cloud solutions which are cheap, efficient and scalable to fit your needs comfortably are business VPNs. 

With a VPN, companies can set up a secure link for employees to connect to the network from remote locations. Unlike traditional proxy services, a business VPN [allows users to use the internet safely](https://www.perimeter81.com/next-gen-business-vpn), even if the website they're interacting with is not using HTTPS.

Why does this secure connection matter? The number of workers using their own unsecured device for work purposes has skyrocketed. According to research performed by [Clutch](https://www.aseonline.org/News/EverythingPeople-This-Week/ArtMID/543/ArticleID/1512/Use-of-Employee-Personal-Devices-for-Work), only 64% of employees are using an approved device for work, and only 40% use a device that's either monitored or cleared for security purposes. 

What are employees doing with their personal device? Nearly 90% of them are checking work-related emails which means they're connected to the company email server, and almost 70% are accessing shared company documents. 

When a company needs to scale, it isn't easy to source all the required hardware and create a safe network, especially when employees are connecting remotely. 

Cloud-based software solutions such as a business VPN allow companies to create secured devices without having to purchase new units and implement costly security programs. 

How do you improve your scalability as a tech company? It's simple. Limit your use of hardware and switch to cloud solutions where possible.
